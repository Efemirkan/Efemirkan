# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi, I’m Efe Mirkan Guner.
I’m currently completing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems at the University of Sussex.

This GitHub profile contains projects from my MSc coursework as well as personal experiments in **agent-based modelling, machine learning, data analysis, and natural language processing (NLP)**. Much of my work focuses on understanding how simple rules and representations can lead to complex behaviour, both in biological and artificial systems.

## About Me ℹ️

I have a background in data analysis and a strong interest in:

- Agent-based models and collective behaviour

- Machine learning and model evaluation

- Natural language processing (text classification, representation, and analysis)

- Decision-making under uncertainty and noise

Many of the repositories here are linked to academic projects, where the emphasis is on **clear modelling assumptions, reproducibility, and careful analysis,** rather than production-level optimisation. 

## What You’ll Find Here

- MSc coursework projects (models, simulations, and reports)

- Python implementations of decision-making and learning models

- NLP experiments and text-based analysis projects

- Parameter sweeps, Monte Carlo experiments, and result visualisation
